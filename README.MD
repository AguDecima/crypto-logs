### Installation 🔧

_BACKEND_
```
To be able to run the back-end it is necessary to have installed node js,
When downloading the folders it should be at the root of the folder and run
the command 'npm i' to install the dependencies.
```

_TO END_

```
Once all these steps are completed, you are able to run the system,
for the backend run the command 'npm start' which starts the system and offers two endpoints.
```

* [api/v1/send-message](https://localhost:3000/api/v1/send-message)
* [api/v1/validate-integrity](https://localhost:3000/api/v1/validate-integrity)

```
If you want to run the project tests you can run the command 'npm test'.
The project has two environment variables, one is PORT to choose the port where the system runs (3000 by default) and another called ATTEMPS (10 by default) to choose the number of records we want to enter in the tests.
```
